# üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **To Implement**

-   Mock transactions on Aleph Zero testnet blockchain to reproduce all possible states of auction along with proposals and other possible transactions and branches
-   Implement fee's into 'Auctioner' 'buy' function
-   Refactor 'Auctioner' functions to check equivalent of USD value instead of native blockchain currency (we will be using Oracles to get proper price feeds here)
-   Implement Vlayer solution into 'Auctioner' 'fulfill' function to ensure cryptographic proof has been provided via email or other credentials
-   Implement Cross Chain solution
-   Consider implementing starting/minimal price for example 100 USD per piece
-   Consider refactor for 'Propose' events on 'Auctioner' and 'Governor' to keep 'ProposalType' only in one of those and avoid duplication

## <u>**Project Overview**</u>

This project is a decentralized auction system that uses smart contracts to manage auctions, mint NFTs (assets), and facilitate user interactions such as buying, proposing changes, voting on those changes, claiming revenues, and more. The system comprises several key contracts: `Auctioner`, `Asset`, and `Governor`. Whole blockchain part has been built and fully tested using `Solidity` language and `Foundry` framework. Libraries used to build this project were fully audited and are free and save to use. All contracts has been already optimized gas wise, tested and are protected with solid usage restrictions.

## <u>**Project Workflow**</u>

![platform](images/platform.png)

-   **Auction Preparation:**

    -   The auction preparation is carried out by a broker, who inputs the detailed information about the asset being auctioned and uploads all relevant investment documents associated with the investment.

-   **Auction Creation:**

    -   The Contract Owner (admin of the platform) reviews the details prepared by the broker. If the admin has no objections, the auction is approved on the platform. This approval triggers the creation of the necessary smart contracts and the upload of documents to IPFS, ensuring they are linked to the specific smart contract and enabling immutable and decentralized storage.

-   **Purchasing Pieces:**

    -   At a predefined moment, the auction opens, allowing users to purchase pieces by sending the required funds. Once all pieces are sold, the auction is automatically closed, and the funds from the sale are transferred directly to the broker.

-   **Refunds:**

    -   If the auction does not succeed (not all pieces are sold within the specified timeframe), users who participated are eligible for a refund. The amount returned to each participant is proportional to their contribution, ensuring that all funds are safely returned if the auction does not reach its goal.

-   **Proposals:**

    -   Users have the ability to propose two types of changes: buyouts or descriptive updates to the auction. These proposals are managed and voted on through the Governor contract.
        1. Buyout Proposals: Enable users to propose an immediate purchase of the entire asset by transferring the required funds.
        2. Descriptive Proposals: Allow updates to the auction‚Äôs description, but only the Foundation is permitted to make these changes.

-   **Withdrawals:**

    -   If a buyout proposal is rejected, the user who made the offer can withdraw the funds.

-   **Auction Finalization:**

    -   If the asset is sold according to the initial investment terms or through a successful buyout proposal, and the funds are deposited into the smart contract, users can claim their share of the revenue by burning the pieces they hold.

## <u>**Automation**</u>

Gelato automation system periodically checks the state of auctions and execute required functions, such as finalizing auctions updating their states etc.

## **üèõÔ∏è** <u>**Auctioner Contract**</u>

The Auctioner contract is responsible for managing auctions within the platform. It includes functionality to start new auctions, place orders, and close auctions once a buying period is over. It also tracks the state of each auction and ensures that the auction rules (e.g., minimum bid increments, auction duration) are enforced. This contract interacts with assets and governs their sale or transfer based on auction outcomes.

## **üìú** <u>**Asset Contract**</u>

The Asset contract represents the NFTs minted during auction creation. Each auctioned asset is minted as an NFT, with users able to buy pieces of the asset. These NFTs can be bought, transferred, and burned based on user interactions with the auction system. The Asset contract also manages the creation, storage, and transfer of assets within the auction system. It handles the minting and burning of tokens (pieces) of assets, and ensures that ownership is properly tracked throughout the lifecycle of the asset. It also implements voting system strictly connected with `Governor` contract.

Each asset is linked to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) via a unique URI, which points to its metadata and visual representation. All assets are based on the ERC721 standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and include standard functions such as mint, transfer, and burn. In this project, we are using the Azuki implementation of ERC721 (ERC721A), which significantly reduces the costs associated with minting, transferring, and burning providing the only such solution in the web3 world where, despite the fractionalization of the asset, the user receives a full-fledged NFT and not a cryptocurrency substitute, i.e. the ERC20 standard.

## **‚öñÔ∏è** <u>**Governor Contract**</u>

The Governor contract is responsible for managing proposals, including buyout proposals and descriptive changes to auctions. It oversees the voting process and determines whether a proposal should be accepted or rejected. Functions from this contract can only be called by the `Auctioner` contract itself, with the exception of the `castVote` function, which allows users to cast votes for each proposal if they hold any linked asset tokens.
