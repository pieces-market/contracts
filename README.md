# üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **To Implement**

-   Mock transactions on Aleph Zero testnet blockchain to reproduce all possible states of auction along with proposals and other possible transactions and branches
-   Implement fee's into 'Auctioner' 'buy' function
-   Refactor 'Auctioner' functions to check equivalent of USD value instead of native blockchain currency (we will be using Oracles to get proper price feeds here)
-   Implement Vlayer solution into 'Auctioner' 'fulfill' function to ensure cryptographic proof has been provided via email or other credentials
-   Implement Cross Chain solution
-   Consider implementing starting/minimal price for example 100 USD per piece
-   Consider refactor for 'Propose' events on 'Auctioner' and 'Governor' to keep 'ProposalType' only in one of those and avoid duplication

## <u>**Project Overview**</u>

This project is a decentralized auction system that uses smart contracts to manage auctions, mint NFTs (assets), and facilitate user interactions such as buying, proposing changes, voting on those changes, claiming revenues, and more. The system comprises several key contracts: `Auctioner`, `Asset`, and `Governor`. Whole blockchain part has been built and fully tested using `Solidity` language and `Foundry` framework. Libraries used to build this project were fully audited and are free and save to use. All contracts has been already optimized gas wise, tested and are protected with solid usage restrictions.

## <u>**Project Workflow**</u>

-   **Auction Creation:**

    -   An auction is created by the contract owner. This process involves minting an NFT (asset) associated with the auction, setting a price per piece, determining the available pieces, and defining the auction's time period.

-   **Purchasing Asset Pieces:**

    -   Users can buy pieces of an asset by sending the required funds. If they purchase all available pieces, the auction is closed, and funds are transferred to the recipient.

-   **Refunds:**

    -   If an auction fails (not all pieces were sold in given time period), users are entitled to refunds based on their contributions.

-   **Proposals:**

    -   Users can propose buyouts or descriptive changes to an auction. The proposals are managed and voted on by the `Governor` contract. Buyout proposals involve transferring funds and allows user to propose instant buyout of whole asset that was auctioned. Descriptive proposals allow for updating auction descriptions and only `Foundation` is allowed to make those. Both proposals are possible to make only when all pieces of an auction were successfully sold.

-   **Withdrawals:**

    -   If buyout proposal fails, offerer is allowed to withdraw contributed funds.

-   **Auction Finalization:**

    -   Once all pieces are sold and 3rd party fulfill their commitment or a buyout succeeds, the auction is finalized. Users can claim their share of the revenues based on the amount of pieces they hold.

-   **Automation:**
    -   Gelato automation system periodically checks the state of auctions and execute required functions, such as finalizing auctions updating their states etc.

## <u>**Auctioner Contract**</u>

The Auctioner contract is responsible for managing auctions within the platform. It includes functionality to start new auctions, place orders, and close auctions once a buying period is over. It also tracks the state of each auction and ensures that the auction rules (e.g., minimum bid increments, auction duration) are enforced. This contract interacts with assets and governs their sale or transfer based on auction outcomes.

## <u>**Asset Contract**</u>

The Asset contract represents the NFTs minted during auction creation. Each auctioned asset is minted as an NFT, with users able to buy pieces of the asset. These NFTs can be bought, transferred, and burned based on user interactions with the auction system. The Asset contract also manages the creation, storage, and transfer of assets within the auction system. It handles the minting and burning of tokens (pieces) of assets, and ensures that ownership is properly tracked throughout the lifecycle of the asset. It also implements voting system strictly connected with `Governor` contract.

Each asset is linked to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) via a unique URI, which points to its metadata and visual representation. All assets are based on the ERC721 standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and include standard functions such as mint, transfer, and burn. In this project, we are using the Azuki implementation of ERC721 (ERC721A), which significantly reduces the costs associated with minting, transferring, and burning providing the only such solution in the web3 world where, despite the fractionalization of the asset, the user receives a full-fledged NFT and not a cryptocurrency substitute, i.e. the ERC20 standard.

## <u>**Governor Contract**</u>

The Governor contract is responsible for managing proposals, including buyout proposals and descriptive changes to auctions. It oversees the voting process and determines whether a proposal should be accepted or rejected. Functions from this contract can only be called by the `Auctioner` contract itself, with the exception of the `castVote` function, which allows users to cast votes for each proposal if they hold any linked asset tokens.
